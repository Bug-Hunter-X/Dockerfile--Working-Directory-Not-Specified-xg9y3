This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the lack of a specified working directory.  The provided `Dockerfile` attempts to run a Python application, but it will likely fail because the `CMD` instruction assumes the application is located in the root directory of the container, which is not the case. The `DockerfileSolution.txt` shows how to correctly define a working directory using the `WORKDIR` instruction, fixing this issue.
